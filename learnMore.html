      </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>Kidney stones are composed of hard, pebble-like pieces of crystallized minerals and salt. Found within the urinary tract (anywhere from the kidneys to the bladder), they usually form when equilibrium shifts in the body cause the urine to become concentrated and allow for minerals to crystallize. Kidney stones can cause significant pain - especially if they become lodged in the urinary tract. </p>

          <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Calcium Stones:</strong> The most common type of kidney stone, that is usually found in the form of calcium oxalate. Oxalate is a substance that is produced by the liver on a daily basis, as well as absorbed through a person’s diet. Calcium stones can also be found in the form of calcium phosphate - which is commonly associated with medications for migraines or seizures (eg: topiramate).</li>
            <li><strong>Struvite Stones:</strong> Usually formed due to urinary tract infections, struvite stones are made of magnesium ammonium phosphate. They are most often created as a result of bacteria (eg: Proteus) that has produced struvite from urea - which causes the urine to become more alkaline. </li>
            <li><strong>Uric Acid Stones:</strong> Composed of urate, uric acid stones are formed due to significant losses of fluids in the body. This loss of fluids can be due to chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, a high-protein diet or diabetes. </li>
            <li><strong>Cystine Stones:</strong> Formed by excess amounts of the amino acid cystine, cystine stones are found in those diagnosed with cystinuria - a hereditary disorder that causes excess production of cystine in the body. </li>
          </ul></p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <p>Gout is inflammatory arthritis that impacts joints within the body. This occurs when equilibrium shifts in the body, enabling urate to crystallize in the joints. Gout is most commonly found in the joint of the big toe and usually impacts one joint in the body at a time. The pain caused by gout, comes in bouts - where there are periods of no symptoms, followed by periods of intense symptoms (known as flares). </p>

              <li><strong>Acute Gout:</strong> Caused by crystallized urate in the joints, acute gout results in short-lived but intense pain that can last for 3 days to 2 weeks.</li>
              <li><strong>Interval/Intercritical Gout:</strong> Occurring between attacks of acute gout, urate will continue to crystallize in joint tissue during this time. Periods of interval/intercritical gout will shorten as an individual's gout progresses.</li>
              <li><strong> Chronic Tophaceous Gout:</strong> As the most debilitating stage of gout, chronic tophaceous gout can result in permanent damage to the joints and kidneys. At this stage, individuals can have chronic arthritis and develop tophi (crystallized urate) in cooler areas of the body (eg: finger joints).</li>

          <h3>Equilibrium for Kidney Stones</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>Equilibrium shifts depend on an individual’s intake of calcium or oxalate rich foods. If a person has a high intake of calcium or oxalate, the concentration of calcium and oxalic acid will increase. This results in equilibrium shifting to the left, and producing kidney stones (CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (s) or Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (s)). This shift in equilibrium relates to the common ion principle - which in this case, simply means that equilibrium is shifted to the left (towards the reactants side) due to the addition of calcium and oxalic acid ions (which already exist on the products’ side). 
          <br><br>
          According to Le Chatelier’s Principle, if the concentration of calcium or oxalic acid ions decreases or disappears completely, equilibrium will shift to the right (towards the products’ side) and attempt to produce calcium/oxalic acid ions by breaking down the solid calcium oxalate (found on the reactants side). At equilibrium, the rate at which the calcium and oxalic acid ions dissociate will be equal to the rate at which the solid calcium oxalate precipitates.

            <div class="col">
              <p>Gout occurs when crystallized monosodium urate forms an insoluble crystalline lattice structure, as a result of changes in equilibrium. These changes in equilibrium occur when there is a high concentration of uric acid. For instance, if an individual has a diet that is high in purine or fructose, the concentration of uric acid will increase as these substances are broken down. This results in equilibrium shifting to the left, and producing gout. According to Le Chatelier's Principle, if the concentration of a product (such as water) decreases or disappears (eg: as a result of diuretics), equilibrium will shift towards the left and attempt to produce the missing substance by breaking down the solid uric acid.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lack of Water:</strong> Less water, means that harmful substances that contribute to the formation of kidney stones cannot be flushed out of the body. This results in the formation of kidney stones - which can cause severe pain in the lower back and abdomen, as well as pain when urinating. This pain can come in waves that fluctuate in intensity.  </li>
              <li><strong>High Sodium Diets:</strong> High sodium diets contribute to the formation of calcium oxalate solids (which are kidney stones). These kidney stones can cause cloudy, foul-smelling, pink, red or brown urine. They can also cause a persistent need to urinate, or urination in drastically large/small amounts. </li>
              <li><strong>Low Calcium Diets:</strong> As calcium decreases, the amount of oxalate available for absorption into the bloodstream increases. This results in equilibrium shifting to the left and producing kidney stones, as oxalate is a promoter of calcium oxalate precipitation. These kidney stones can cause nausea and vomiting, as well as fevers and chills if an infection is present. </li>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Use of Certain Medications:</strong> Consuming certain medications such as diuretics (water pills) can contribute to the formation of gout, as they increase urination - which reduces the amount of fluids remaining in the body. This gout can result in a limited range of motion that prevents individuals from moving their joints as much as they normally would have previously.</li>
                  <li><strong>Purine-Rich Diets:</strong> Foods rich in purines such as red meats and certain seafood (eg: anchovies) can be broken down into uric acid, which results in the formation of gout. This can lead to intense, debilitating joint pain (eg: in the big toe, ankles, knees) that is the most severe within the first 4-12 hours.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fructose-Rich Diets:</strong> Consuming foods rich in fructose leads to excess uric acid being produced as the fructose is broken down in the body. This contributes to the formation of gout, which causes lingering discomfort that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks after the most severe pain has subsided.</li>
                  <li><strong>Consuming High Amounts of Alcohol:</strong> Consuming high amounts of alcohol can lead to the creation of gout, because alcohol (eg: beer) contains high amounts of purine - which can be broken down into uric acid. This leads to gout, which causes inflammation and redness around the impacted joints.</li>

                  <li><strong>To Individuals:</strong> One important message to remember, is that our bodies are impacted by what we eat. This is why in our everyday lives, it is important to be conscious of what we're consuming. Diets high in fructose and purine, can lead to the formation of gout - which causes debilitating pain. We can reduce our chances of having to experience this, by eating a healthy, balanced diet.</li>
                  <li><strong>To Individuals:</strong> Another message, is to remember the importance of paying attention to our mental health and how we cope with stress in our lives. Many people who turn to alcohol, do so as a means of coping with stress - oftentimes, because they are unaware of alternative coping mechanisms. This can lead to them experiencing gout as a result. However, by promoting therapy and education on healthy coping mechanisms, we can reduce the number of individuals in our society who have been impacted by gout as a result of alcohol consumption.</li>
